# Landing_Page_AB_Testing

This is my submission for the A/B Testing Project in Udacity's Advanced Data Analysis Nanodegree.

In this project we analyze whether a site should choose their old or new landing page by creating an A/B test based on conversion rate.
We first label the treatment and control groups, Bootstrap sample the data, and then do our hypothesis test!

Then we try to implement the same thing using statsmodels, and expand on it by considering other features as well.

If you trying to do the Udacity project, feel free to check out my solution, but please don't copy it :)
